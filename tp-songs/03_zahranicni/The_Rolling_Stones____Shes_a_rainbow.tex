Have you seen her dressed in <F>blue?
See the sky in front of you
And her face is lik a sail
Speck of white so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fai<Bb>rer?
She comes in colors ev'ry<Eb>where
She combs her <Bb>hair
She's like a <Bb7>rain<Bb>bow
Coming, colors in the <Eb>air
Oh, every<Bb>where
She comes in <F>co<Bb>lors

\zs
Have you seen her all in gold?
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots her colors all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer?
She comes in colors ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colors in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colors
